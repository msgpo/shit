# Using `cat` as a text editor
---------------------------------
This can be done to easily insert bits of text
that may be longer than one line, (as such done via echo)

```
cat > /path/to/file << "EOF"
this is
a bunch
of text here
EOF
```

Alternatively, you can simply type cat > file
and then press ^D when you wish to save
